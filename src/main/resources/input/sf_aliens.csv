The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.com",1985,"{'Science Fiction': 15715, 'Fiction': 7798, 'Young Adult': 4781, 'Fantasy': 2976, 'Classics': 1947, 'Science Fiction Fantasy': 1574, 'Science Fiction (Dystopia) ': 1195, 'War': 708, 'Audiobook': 633, 'Adventure': 611}",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game

And Kordolians are usually too busy conquering the important parts of the nine galaxies to bother with us. But it looks as if their battle cruiser is broken. Probably shot up in a firefight. They're going to use every means necessary to fix it, even if it means putting Fortuna Tau on lockdown. I just hope they don't decide to enslave us and ship us off to some remote alien planet. Come to think of it, I've never seen a Kordolian up close before. They're huge, with strange silver skin and pointed ears. They have freaky nano-armor. And they're packing a serious arsenal. Our human technology has no chance against their weapons. When I encounter their General, I find him insufferable. Arrogant. Domineering. He won't tell me anything. I guess that's what happens when your race is kicking ass across the nine galaxies. You get pigheaded. So why do I keep running into him? Why is he looking at me funny? And what's with this weird feeling I get when he's around? I really hope these guys fix their ship and go away soon, because I get the feeling they could be major trouble.  Tarak  Sucked into a wormhole during a fierce skirmish with an enemy ship. Spat out near a human mining station in a remote corner of the nine galaxies. Stuck with weak humans who operate with inferior metals and technology. This mission couldn't get any worse. We need to fix our craft before the wormhole collapses. We need to hunt the cursed Xargek monsters that have infiltrated this human rust-bucket. And these infernal headaches of mine are getting worse. I don't really care about these humans. Their existence makes no sense to me. All I care about is killing Xargek and getting back to my home planet, Kythia. This situation is tiresome. The light of the star humans call the Sun burns my eyes. I crave Kythia's darkness. So why has this crazy human female captured my attention? She's messy, awkward and she babbles nonsense half the time. These humans are crazy. I don't understand them at all. Especially this female. Why do I keep coming back to her?

I have a boring life, an awful job, and a boss that throws staplers at my head. What could be worse?  How about being abducted by Aliens?  Being dragged through a mirror, naked and screaming, onto an extraterrestrial ship was bad. Finding out I had been sold to a huge alien male who looks like the Devil was worse.

They will defend their females to the last drop of blood in their huge, blue bodies.  And there are more… so many more Alien warriors to pick from.Which type of male would you choose?

As for his past, that's not up for discussion.Then, in the wake of an accidental cliff collapse, Jack discovers a seam of unimaginably valuable jewels, to which he manages to lay legal claim just as ZaraCorp is cancelling their contract with him for his part in causing the collapse. Briefly in the catbird seat, legally speaking, Jack pressures ZaraCorp into recognizing his claim, and cuts them in as partners to help extract the wealth.But there's another wrinkle to ZaraCorp's relationship with the planet Zarathustra. Their entire legal right to exploit the verdant Earth-like planet, the basis of the wealth they derive from extracting its resources, is based on being able to certify to the authorities on Earth that Zarathustra is home to no sentient species.Then a small furry biped—trusting, appealing, and ridiculously cute—shows up at Jack's outback home. Followed by its family. As it dawns on Jack that despite their stature, these are people, he begins to suspect that ZaraCorp's claim to a planet's worth of wealth is very flimsy indeed…and that ZaraCorp may stop at nothing to eliminate the ""fuzzys"" before their existence becomes more widely known.",2011,"{'Science Fiction': 941, 'Fiction': 292, 'Audiobook': 174, 'Fantasy': 86, 'Humor': 77, 'Science Fiction (Aliens) ': 69, 'Science Fiction Fantasy': 68, 'Space (Space Opera) ': 40, 'Adventure': 36, 'Adult': 33}",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9647532-fuzzy-nation

In the process, she was captured by an alien scientist and became a experiment herself-a sexual experiment. Captain Alalakan don al' Chardadon was not about to let Dr. Rodak don al' Bakom conduct his ridiculous sexual experiments on an inhabitant from a newly discovered world. Even if it meant he had to marry the Earth woman to protect her. Marriages were easily dissolved on his planet, and this alien was very beautiful. Besides, he wanted her-in his bed, on the floor, against the wall, or anywhere else he could think of. Brianna had to choose-marry the captain or try to find another way to escape Bakom. Easy choice. Even though he was an alien, Char was the most desirable man she'd ever met. So, Brianna finds herself hurtling through space married to a very sexy alien-with a very flexible tail-from a planet where hedonism is the norm and there are three sexes: male, female, and hermaphrodite.

The Warrior’s Pet,English,Stephanie West,English,4.02,870,116,"Giselle didn't know how long she lay near catatonic willing the terrible headache to go away. She sat up as one of the reptilian aliens entered. Giselle backed up and looked around realizing she was alone in a gilded cage. ""What's going on?"" She stammered. ""If you're wise you'll keep quiet, pets don't speak on this planet."" The creature admonished. A pet? Giselle's eyes widened. She hadn't misheard. Her cage was moved into a large tent. There were hundreds of aliens gathered for the auction, and these creatures were the largest yet. Their flesh was red like some kind of demon might be, with hair a uniform dark black. From what Giselle could see their eyes were a stone cold obsidian hue. Giselle noticed the fearsome creatures had long tails that rose out from what looked like chain mail kilts. Giselle shrunk back when she saw the creatures also had sharp fangs. How in the hell could she get out of this and if she did how could she possibly survive on an alien planet?  Kagan beheld his pet. Nothing like her kind had ever set foot on Cadi. Kagan wondered where in the universe her unique species hailed from. Giselle refused to behave and even enjoyed his attempts to rebuke her, reveling in the rough handling a male usually held back with females. Giselle was brave instead of meek, standing up for herself in a sea of foreigners. Kagan had at first insisted that Giselle understand her place in Cadi society. But something more valuable than precious metal or jewels would be lost if Giselle was forced into the role everyone thought she belonged.  Can Giselle find acceptance and love on an alien planet or will she always be nothing more than a warrior's pet?This book has adult content and may have triggers for some.",2016,"{'Science Fiction (Aliens) ': 49, 'Science Fiction': 34, 'Romance': 22, 'Fantasy': 15, 'Adult Fiction (Erotica) ': 14, 'Romance (Science Fiction Romance) ': 11, 'Romance (Erotic Romance) ': 7, 'Romance (Paranormal Romance) ': 6, 'Fantasy (Paranormal) ': 3, 'Space': 3}",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30115279-the-warrior-s-pet

That’s why aliens rarely bother to come to this corner of the universe. And Kordolians are usually too busy conquering the important parts of the nine galaxies to bother with us.But it looks as if their battle cruiser is broken. Probably shot up in a firefight. They’re going to use every means necessary to fix it, even if it means putting Fortuna Tau on lockdown. I just hope they don’t decide to enslave us and ship us off to some remote alien planet.Come to think of it, I’ve never seen a Kordolian up close before. They’re huge, with strange, silver skin and pointed ears. They have freaky nano-armor. And they’re packing a serious arsenal.

He won’t tell me anything.I guess that’s what happens when your race is kicking ass across the nine galaxies. You get pigheaded.So why do I keep running into him? Why is he looking at me funny?

Every human girl growing up on New Terrhan knows one thing… that she will be taken by one or several Xalthurian males when she turns twenty-one. The Xalthurians are rough, domineering, and huge all over. But, this is the deal our leaders struck, so that they would provide our human colony with desperately needed supplies...

The sequel to The Scorpion's Mate... 

A desperate escape from a prison cell inside an alien research facility leaves Joanie in the clutches of an alien with a handsome face, a great body, and tentacles that could have come out of a horror movie. Her life back on Earth is a mess, but nowhere near as complicated as her new situation becomes when the alien test subject named Nemon decides that she's his mate. 
Nemon knows that Joanie is the mate he's hoping for as soon as Thrax hands her to him, but he can also see that she's frightened and traumatized. He must win a battle against his own body - which has a mind of its own--to maintain control, so he can win her trust and avoid frightening her further. His newfound friends warn him that Joanie will need time to accept him, and Nemon is willing to wait, but they all may have underestimated Joanie. 
They have escaped their fate as Iriduan test subjects, but Nemon and Joanie can't escape the legacy left behind by their captors. A legacy that brings them together - a legacy that also threatens to tear them apart.

Whisked to a world as technologically advanced as the first was primitive, where nanotech computers are grown inside people's skulls, and few have any interest in venturing outside the enormous whitestone cities, Cass finds herself processed as a 'stray', a refugee displaced by the gates torn between worlds. Struggling with an unfamiliar language and culture, she must adapt to virtual classrooms, friends who can teleport, and the ingrained attitude that strays are backward and slow.  Can Cass ever find her way home? And after the people of her new world discover her unexpected value, will they be willing to let her leave?",2011,"{'Science Fiction': 162, 'Young Adult': 157, 'Fantasy': 68, 'Science Fiction (Aliens) ': 41, 'Fiction': 29, 'Adventure': 25, 'Romance': 23, 'Fantasy (Paranormal) ': 19, 'Science Fiction Fantasy': 12, 'Young Adult (Young Adult Fantasy) ': 11}",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10837174-stray

Wandering the fringes of space as a salvager, he comes across a planet beyond the boundaries of the federation, rich in metals remnant of a dead civilization. Or so he thought.  Confronted by cannibalistic mutations of the indigenous species, his salvage has suddenly become a lot more complicated. Even more so when he encounters a female surviving on her own. She is strong and fearless, begrudgingly earning his admiration. Terri is hardened by a life of hunger and watchfulness, and yet is moved by a compassion that he’s never possessed. When his admiration turns into the first signs of a forming mate-bond, he knows his fate is sealed. Unlicensed mating is forbidden—if his malfunctioning wasn’t already a death sentencing, taking her for her mate would be. Yet, he finds that letting her go is no longer an option.

The Serpent's Mate,"The Serpent's Mate (Iriduan Test Subjects, #3)",Susan Trombley,English,4.02,1203,118,"
When Cass is abducted by aliens and sold to an alien pirate queen who collects female slaves to harvest their pheromones, her first experience with extra-terrestrials quickly turns from surreal into a nightmare, which only grows more terrifying when an alien with a snake-like lower body and a surprisingly handsome face comes to her rescue. But Cass isn't sure she's actually safe with him, because he looks at her with hunger in his eyes. 
Nahash has always been a loyal, honourable Iriduan soldier. After distinguishing himself above his peers, the genetically-enhanced warrior volunteered for an experimental program to create a hybrid with powerful psionic abilities, using DNA taken from a giant serpent that decimated one of their outer colonies. Though his body changed into a form beyond the scientists' expectations, his mind became a weapon that could alter the very course of Iriduan civilization, perhaps even saving it from its inevitable ruin. 
After such drastic alterations to his biology, scientists told him he was free from the affliction that caused Iriduan males to imprint on a single female, bonding him to her for life. The last thing he expects is to bond instantly to a human female he rescues during a raid on a pirate colony. Now, he's stuck with her, because if he isn't exposed to his mate's scent on a regular basis, he will die. The fact that his body craves her as much as it needs her fills him with resentment, but when he realizes that the Iriduan Empire will do anything to keep her under their control because of what she means to him, he doesn't hesitate to protect his mate - even if it means betraying his people. 
The rogue test subject and the abducted human make a desperate escape from the Iriduan Empire, but the galaxy proves to be a dangerous place and there are worse things than the Iriduans waiting in the darkness of space. With no one to rely on except for each other, Nahash and Cass might not live long enough to find a home where they can settle down and explore the love that grows between them - love that takes them beyond their physical bond. 
Author's Note: 18+ Contains steamy scenes between a human heroine and a very alien hero.

Right when Captain Alec Hamlin thinks it can’t get any crazier, his team is sold to their captors’ mighty sovereign. King Zercy of the Kríe. Ruler of the planet’s most formidable species. Man, is he imposing. So regal and larger than life. And way too savagely handsome for Alec’s liking. From the first moment he laid eyes on him, he knew the Kríe was trouble, knew he needed to steer clear of him at all costs. But when Zercy chooses Alec to be his personal pet, all plans to dodge the male fall by the wayside. Alec is forced to spend each evening in the alluring king’s company, each night bound to the seductive king’s bed. Wholly at his mercy. Utterly defenseless, in his own mind and most especially his restless body. His struggle is real. Because the more Alec gets to know Zercy, the more he realizes two things. The Kríe king is damaged—unstable, not right, making him unpredictable and highly dangerous. But he is also innately kind beneath the raging storm that torments him. Kind and genuine, with a sad but beautiful soul. Something Alec fights with all he is, not to acknowledge. He can’t fall for Zercy. Zercy is the enemy. The captor of both Alec and his team. Which means Alec needs to get them out of there, before it’s too late. Before emotions overthrow logic and take control of the wheel. If only his body didn’t crave Zercy so fiercely, and his heart didn’t want him just as badly. With Search and Rescue due any day, and Alec’s team getting antsy, Alec is forced to make a decision. He can’t have it both ways. Is he the captain of his men, bound to obligation, or is he a man in love with a Kríe?

Always feeling apart, even among his species, Jomny feels at home for the first time among the earthlings he meets. There is a bear tired of other creatures running in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, a turtle hiding itself by learning camouflage, a puppy struggling to express its true feelings, and many more.The characters are unique and inventive—bees think long and hard about what love means, birds try to eat the sun, nothingness questions its own existence, a ghost comes to terms with dying, and an introverted hedgehog slowly lets Jomny see its artistic insecurities. At the same time, Jomny’s curious presence allows these characters to open up to him in ways they were never able to before, revealing the power of somebody who is just there to listen.Everyone’s a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too is also the story behind the widely-shared and typo-filled @jonnysun twitter account. Since the beginning, Sun intentionally tweeted from an outsider’s perspective, creating a truly distinct voice. Now, that outsider has taken shape in the character of Jomny, who observes Earth with the same intelligent, empathetic, and charmingly naïve voice that won over his fans on social media. New fans will find it organic, and old fans will delight at seeing the clever words that made them fans in the first place.Through this story of a lost, lonely and confused Alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the animals and plants of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human.

General Tarak wants me to stay put, but there’s no way I’m sitting around in his claustrophobic quarters. I need to be looking for a way to get back home. Fortuna Tau is being overrun by disgusting, oversized insects, and I’m stuck here, at the other end of the universe. On the upside, at least my injuries are healed. The General is being a big, arrogant jerk. He won’t tell me anything. He’s walking around his quarters half-dressed, unaware that his bare, sculpted torso is a bit too distracting. And the food on this station leaves a lot to be desired. Kordolians obviously haven’t discovered the glory of nachos yet. At this rate I don’t know if I’ll ever get to taste chocolate again. When I ask when he’s going to take me back, he gets evasive. I don’t like that. So when he has to leave me alone to attend to some official business, I decide to explore. Sneaking around this huge, floating station, I soon realize that not all Kordolians are as, uh, friendly as the General. To some of them, I’m nothing more than a giant, walking lab rat. I really have to find a way to get back home. Before I end up on a dissection table.  Tarak  To my relief, the nanograft is a success.

Ascend,B07L9JKMFW,Sandra R. Neeley,None,4.33,1924,285,"Command Warship 1 is home to one of the most feared males in the multi-verse. Zha Quin Tha is Sire to his people, next in line to the throne. He rules his military with an iron hand. His people, the Cruestaci, are a warrior race who bow to no one and nothing. They’ve been deemed too violent to be an ally by the Unified Consortium Defense — the organization responsible for keeping peace between all peoples and worlds. Zha Quin didn’t care what their opinion was. He was only violent when necessary — like when provoked, or if his planet was threatened, or a weaker people overrun, or he was just irritated in general. Like now, slavers had crossed into the territory of Cruestace. He’d been called in to intercept and process the kidnapped women on board to the Consortium for return to their home worlds. Little did he know, his whole existence was about to be turned upside down. One little, human female was about to teach him a thing or two about survival, patience, and trust.  One large room — every wall, the entire floor, even the ceiling covered in mats. This is now Vivian’s home. Her world extends no further than the end of the chain that keeps her anchored in the center of the room. She’s learned how to use that chain as a weapon. She had to — her captors find great sport in taunting her, abusing her, hurting her. She’s exhausted, nearly starved, injured and if truth be told — not long for this world, whatever the hell world it is. All she’s got left is her pride, and she’ll be damned if she gives that up to any of her alien captors. They want to play — she’ll play — and she’ll make sure they pay for it in bruises and pain the next day. They may win, but they’ll think twice next time. Days run together, no hope of ever being freed. Survival seems pointless, until she finds herself face to face with the largest, scariest male she’s ever seen. So be it — she’s got nothing to lose — she’ll fight him, too. Maybe this time her misery will finally come to an end. She has no idea this male is different. This male is stronger than the rest. This male will be her Haven.  Warning: Intended for mature audiences. This book contains violence, abuse both real and inferred, and sexual situations that may be disturbing for some readers.

The Book of Strange New Things,The Book of Strange New Things,Michel Faber,English,3.67,28373,4163,"A monumental, genre-defying novel over ten years in the making, Michel Faber's The Book of Strange New Things is a masterwork from a writer in full command of his many talents.It begins with Peter, a devoted man of faith, as he is called to the mission of a lifetime, one that takes him galaxies away from his wife, Bea. Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment, overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter's teachings—his Bible is their ""book of strange new things."" But Peter is rattled when Bea's letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries, and governments are crumbling. Bea's faith, once the guiding light of their lives, begins to falter. Suddenly, a separation measured by an otherworldly distance, and defined both by one newly discovered world and another in a state of collapse, is threatened by an ever-widening gulf that is much less quantifiable. While Peter is reconciling the needs of his congregation with the desires of his strange employer, Bea is struggling for survival. Their trials lay bare a profound meditation on faith, love tested beyond endurance, and our responsibility to those closest to us. Marked by the same bravura storytelling and precise language that made The Crimson Petal and the White such an international success, The Book of Strange New Things is extraordinary, mesmerizing, and replete with emotional complexity and genuine pathos.",2014,"{'Fiction': 913, 'Science Fiction': 797, 'Religion': 153, 'Fantasy': 144, 'Literary Fiction': 93, 'Audiobook': 79, 'Science Fiction (Dystopia) ': 73, 'Science Fiction Fantasy': 72, 'Speculative Fiction': 69, 'Adult Fiction': 61}",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20697435-the-book-of-strange-new-things

I’ve been abducted by aliens and auctioned to an alien pirate. My epic love of movies sort of comes in handy, what with all the sci-fi suddenly in my face.

But with my new 'owners,' I’m safe for the first time in a long time--and so is my little girl. Not that everything is all raindrops on roses, and innocent kittens: they’re pirates. They’ve got a real addiction to plundering, and a passion for purloining. I’m pretty fond of the former, but when it comes to the thieving, I’m afraid they’re going to take more than my body. ...Piece by piece, all five of my pirates are stealing my *heart.*  **Note: Beth’s Stable is a standalone Reverse Harem romance where five men woo one woman.

Dark Planet Warriors: Escape,B01CW1ASI8,Anna Carven,English,4.14,1138,66,"Abbey  Ever since we left the Fleet Station, Tarak has been his usual cryptic self. For some reason, he’s keeping everything very low-key, to the extent that we’re trying to sneak in to Kythia. Something’s up, and he’s not telling me anything. Every time I try to get answers, he distracts me with his stupid sexiness. Stupid sexy, silver, stubborn, insistent alien. Why can’t he just keep his damn hands to himself? And why do I suck at resisting his advances? There’s something he’s not telling me. He’s up to something shady, and I don’t like it. I guess I have no choice but to stick with him for now, because half of Kythia is out to get me, and who better to have by your side than the most lethal soldier in the Kordolian military? We’ll just have to work on his communication skills, a little, that’s all.  Tarak  Kythia is a dangerous place for a Human, but I must go there. The safest place in the universe for Abbey right now is by my side, so she comes with me. She will not enjoy the trip, but I aim to keep it brief. Besides, I cannot keep my hands off her. She mystifies and perplexes me, and yet I find myself addicted to her warmth, her scent, and her sweet taste. She does not know the extent of the danger facing us. The High Council want my head. They may send assassins after us. The barren wastelands of the Vaal, where we must go, are cold and harsh and completely disconnected from civilization. But I must find the tortured Prince, and drag him back to reality. There are plans I wish to put in place to ensure the survival of our race, and he, just like my precious Human, is an integral part of them. We may be returning to Earth sooner than she thinks.  Dark Planet Warriors is a 3-book serial. Each book is an episode of Abbey and Tarak's story, just like a TV series.

Alien Species Intervention,B00GS2W6T2,J.K. Accinni,English,3.83,1001,192,"Two hundred years of tender love between man and alien, political downfalls, wanton violence of unspeakable order tempered with laughter, family loyalty and hope is the thrilling vehicle by which Ms. Accinni conveys her cautionary tale of the merciless disrespect man gives his planet and the vulnerable creatures entrusted to him. This charming, yet brutal saga will chill and surprise you as it foretells the selfishly destructive path man has followed since his species evolved. It pulls no punches while allowing Netty and Baby's influence to transcend mortal life as the world dances toward depraved indifference, introducing other characters along the ride that readers will laugh and shed tears with, and learn to despise. ""Baby"" introduces Netty, a naive teenage farm girl given in marriage to an older brutal opportunist disguised as a successful citizen during the years of Prohibition in Sussex County, New Jersey. After years of enslavement, Netty flees into the night from her rapist and bootlegger husband, traveling back to the farm worked by her parents, where she rescues an unfamiliar damaged creature she finds in a cave in the woods of her childhood, falling in love with the enigmatic alien she names Baby. Together they find happiness and fulfillment despite the changes to Netty's body wrought by the proximity of the unusual creature. Damaged by entry into our atmosphere while pregnant, the confused creature forgets the purpose of his mission, appearing unconcerned with the disappearance of his offspring and savoring the unexpected joy of the love he shares with young Netty. When a handsome Italian stranger comes into Netty's life, complications ensue as she falls in love while trying to hide the bizarre and wondrous changes to her farm and her body. Netty, Baby and Wil strive to conquer obstacles thrown in their path by life, succeeding wildly until the heart-rending and astonishingly brutal climax to their story. What lengths will Baby and his offspring go to complete their mission? Will it spell Armageddon for the beleaguered planet with its vulnerable and exploited creatures or will man tip the scales himself, leaving those that love the creatures to salvage the pitiful ruins? In ""Echo"", Netty's influence transcends a full century as the United States evolves to a point of politically driven economic collapse. The year is 2033 as a young mother, abused by her shiftless husband, heroically decides to remove her two sickly children, Scotty and Abby, from the mean streets of their government subsidized tenement town of Short Hills, New Jersey to the hills and old farmland of Sussex County. There they unite with a Latino family that adopted Jose, a young boy from Costa Rica, traumatized at the age of seven by the brutal murder of his parents and the kidnapping of his infant sister. The two families unite to pool finances, creating the love and bonds that will enable them to survive the psychotic attention of Armoni, a soul damaged beyond redemption, discovery of Baby's miraculous offspring, Echo; and their subsequent body changes. Through the efforts of Echo who develops an unexplained passion for the curly haired dog, Barney, they flee the clutches of Armoni after the murder of Armoni's sidekicks by Echo, to Sarasota, Florida, one of the last remaining enclaves of wealth in the U.S. Scotty learns to utilize Echo as a co-conspirator in his intrigue to thwart the efforts of heinous people that prey on the lives of creatures in their environmentally rich new home, where the insidious miscreant, Armoni, tracks them; bringing brutality and violence to all.Having fallen in love, the young Abby and Jose draw close, only to be separated by the transcendental Netty, who tries to use Abby as a conduit in her plan to rescue as much wildlife as they can before despicable political events bring on the specter of Armageddon...",2013,"{'Science Fiction': 48, 'Horror': 46, 'Fantasy (Paranormal) ': 31, 'Science Fiction (Aliens) ': 30, 'Science Fiction (Dystopia) ': 28, 'Fantasy': 22, 'Dark': 21, 'Thriller': 18, 'Young Adult': 15, 'Wildlife': 12}",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18874565-alien-species-intervention

Then a four-armed alien with the face of a dangerous lion reveals that his heart is not so predatory, when he comes to her aid and saves her life.

Invasion,B00TADUV1Q,Sean Platt,English,3.67,3489,402,"They are coming. The countdown has begun.First visible only as blips on a telescope image, the discovery of objects approaching from Jupiter orbit immediately sets humanity on edge. NASA doesn't even bother to deny the alien ships' existence. The popular Astral space app (broadcasting from the far side of the moon and accessible by anyone with internet) has already shown the populace what is coming. So the news has turned from evasion to triage, urging calm and offering the few facts they have: The objects are enormous, perfectly round spheres numbering in the dozens, maybe hundreds. They are on an approach vector for Earth. And they will arrive in six days. Fear simmers.Meyer Dempsey - mogul, wealthy entrepreneur, arrogant and always in charge - is in New York, on the phone with his ex-wife in LA when the news breaks. He can hear tension in the voices of reporters and experts chronicling all that's known and unknown. But even while those supposedly in charge restrain their own panic, Meyer finds he recognizes bits and pieces of what the world is facing. He's seen this in dreams - in visions of another place. He knows where he and his family must go. He has prepared … though he never knew until now what he'd been preparing for. He knows only they cannot hesitate. They must run to their safe haven in the Colorado mountains. Now. Before society shatters into chaos, and it all falls apart. Fear rises.Meyer has been taking steps for months, and has made preparations: a trove of supplies, a van stocked for the worst, a Gulfstream waiting at a small airstrip in Jersey. But he hasn't yet been able to take the final and most important step: moving the family to Colorado, where every contingency is covered. The networks stay on-air longer than expected, creating a farce of calm. But those with means have already begun to scramble as Meyer gathers his wife Piper and his two teenage children and begins their race toward that compound, toward safety. There is no time for hesitation, regret, or pity. Soon, pundits begin to ask questions hard enough to tip those who've thus far stayed calm out of their complacency, inciting chaos: What do the beings inside the ships want? What will they do when they arrive? And what if the scientists are wrong, and the spheres aren't decelerating? Will they strike the planet, raising clouds of extinction dust? Will they knock the Earth off its axis? Is this a prelude to an alien invasion? An alien war? An alien apocalypse? The first domino in the birth of a new alien empire? Fear erupts.Panic, once it breaches the thin crust of civilized society, spreads like a virus. Meyer knows only one thing, and it's a truth that has perched atop his mind like a psychic obsession: When the ships arrive, his family must be at the Colorado compound or all will be lost. The space fleet in itself doesn't matter. The disintegration on the surviving news outlets does not matter. Reports that Las Vegas has been set ablaze do not matter. The fate of humanity, in Meyer's eyes, doesn't matter.All that matters is Piper. Trevor. Delilah. And Meyer's ex-wife Heather, coming to the same destination from the west - a woman who remains his best friend, and his secret lover. Rioting spills into the highways as time ticks away. Unrest boils in both city and hinterlands. But Meyer's obsession to reach Vail is single-minded, guided with the focus of a far-seeing nightmare. Gangs can ground his plane, threaten his vehicles, and steal his belongings. But nothing will stand between Meyer's family and their haven … and Meyer will kill his way to Colorado if he has to.

Hero,"Hero (Galactic Gladiators, #3)",Anna Hackett,English,4.28,1830,140,"Fighting for love, honor, and freedom on the galaxy’s lawless outer rim…  Raised from birth to be a soldier, Kace Tameron is a disciplined, military-trained gladiator. He is on contract to the Kor Magna Arena to hone his fighting skills on the blood-soaked arena sand and then return to the military. He lives for one thing: to protect his planet, and on his world, love is forbidden. But then he collides with a feisty redhead from Earth who threatens to shatter his legendary control.  One moment, Rory Fraser was an engineer on a space station circling Jupiter and the next, she is abducted by evil alien slavers. After suffering at the hands of the Thraxians, she is rescued by her friends—with the help of the tough gladiators of the House of Galen. Rory finds herself outrageously attracted to straight-laced Kace. He is a skilled fighter, ultra-disciplined, and a hero at heart—but she knows passion beats within him, if only he’ll let it loose.  Rory is obsessed with finding another fellow abducted female from Earth, but as she asks questions, she finds herself ducking bullets and explosions. Someone wants Rory dead. Kace steps in as her protector, and together, they embark on a dangerous mission that will take them deep into the bowels of the arena, and deep into a scorching desire…both of which could lead them to lose not only their guarded hearts, but their lives as well.  Note to readers: This sci fi romance contains a lot of action (think wild gladiatorial fights and daring rescues), tough gladiators (the warriors of the House of Galen) and a steamy romance (between a feisty engineer and a disciplined, uptight gladiator). So if you like it fast, and gritty, and sexy, this is for you!  Includes a preview of Marcus, the first book in the Hell Squad series. ___________________________________________________  Q & A with the Author  Q - How would you describe the Galactic Gladiators series? A – Gladiators in space! The desert planet of Carthago is home to the Kor Magna Arena: it’s a mix of low and high tech. Think the Colosseum of Ancient Rome with a touch of professional sports and a side of Las Vegas glitz and temptation. You’ll see a lot of action-packed romance as women abducted from Earth clash with tough, gritty gladiators fighting for love, honor, and freedom.  Q - Why did you want to write the series? A – It’s no secret that I love action, adventure and romance. And I love science fiction romance and all the endless possibilities. Raiden, the gladiator hero of Gladiator, stormed into my head and wanted his story told. I saw this big, tough man covered in tattoos facing off with an equally tough female space marine from Earth. That’s where it all began, and since then the planet of Carthago, the intrigues of the Kor Magna Arena, and an amazing band of gladiators came to life.  Q - What order should I read the books in? A - All the Galactic Gladiator books will be stand-alone romances centered on the Kor Magna Arena, rescuing abducted humans, and making a life far from home. Here's the order I suggest:  - Gladiator - Warrior - Hero More gladiators coming soon!  About Anna: I'm passionate about all things action romance. I love stories that combine the thrill of falling in love with the excitement of action, danger and adventure. I write about people overcoming unbeatable odds and achieving seemingly impossible goals. I like to believe it's possible for all of us to do the same.",2016,"{'Romance': 54, 'Science Fiction': 36, 'Science Fiction (Aliens) ': 27, 'Romance (Science Fiction Romance) ': 16, 'Romance (Paranormal Romance) ': 14, 'Fantasy (Paranormal) ': 8, 'Fantasy': 8, 'Adult Fiction (Erotica) ': 6, 'Action': 5, 'Adult': 4}",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33267330-hero

By the end of it, Val had finished the first volume of her history of the bugger wars and transmitted it by ansible, under Demosthenes' name, back to Earth, and Ender had won something better than the adulation of the passengers.

But Ankari Markovich is trouble from the start, nearly eluding his elite forces, then fighting and tricking his people left and right. He finds himself admiring her spirit, but according to her warrant, she’s a criminal. The safest thing is to keep her in the brig and ignore her until she can be handed off to the man who wants her.But the situation grows more complicated when other bounty hunters show up, wanting to claim Ankari for themselves. Thanks to this woman, Viktor’s ship is in danger, his crew members are going missing, and he’s fighting enemies he never asked for in a jungle in the middle of a hurricane. He’s either going to strangle Ankari… or fall in love. Either scenario could get him killed.Mercenary Instinct is a full-length, stand-alone novel of 90,000 words.

She’s on the run from a violent past...



He solves his problems with a sword...


Fleeing a life of abuse, Sheri climbs aboard a mail-order mate spaceship bound for a distant station, but never arrives… Fate intervenes and her trip takes a quick, deadly turn when she crashes on the planet Atera. She’s surrounded by endless sand dunes, dangerous creatures, and alien beings that remind her of Earth lizards. But one particular lizard hardly leaves her thoughts - a sexy, two legged, muscular male bent on protecting and caring for her at all costs!
Drazan is a fierce warrior, the strongest Ateran of the Red Sands, he rules his dunes with an iron fist and sharp sword, and is honour bound to face all challengers to his position. During one of these battles something… strange… happens. Fire rains from the skies and a strange black metal box filled with females crashes to the sands. All thoughts of fighting are lost to the allure of these odd humans - especially one deliciously curvy female who stirs his blood. Now he finds himself with dark yearnings, strong need, and a hardness between his legs that he’s never used before!
With Sheri consuming his thoughts, Drazan may have forgotten about his last challenge but his opponent’s brother hasn’t. Now he’s determined to see Drazan suffer… even if that means killing Sheri!

Viper's Hope,B01LGQULE6,Stephanie West,English,4.00,415,49,"Hope covered her ringing ears as she stared wide eyed at the molten rock strafing across the sky. It got larger and brighter with the smoke trail parting the horizon. The sudden eruption of water out at sea was cataclysmic as the meteor struck. The wave of water that barreled towards San Francisco a moment later was small at first but grew in size. Hope watched aghast as the water pushed aside massive buildings. She couldn't even fathom the level of devastation occurring in front of her. As if the tragedy she'd witnessed wasn't enough, something lurked in the trees outside her campsite. Hope watched as a portion of the tree separated from the trunk. The colors morphed into a bronzed, earthy tan figure of a man. The camouflaged man was at least seven feet tall with well-built legs and a massive broad chest. He swayed hypnotically as he walked like some kind of sleek predator. His facial features were not human, yet not altogether frightening. He was an alien, a giant freaking alien, and he was abducting her! Before the scourge of the universe struck Viper had never aspired to do more than rule his people, but his entire life had changed in the blink of an eye. The tragedy galvanized him with a single-minded purpose to see to it that he defended the Anguis and any other race unfortunate enough to cross paths with the plague and wipe it from existence. Finding his mate was the farthest thing from his mind as Viper attempted to rescue the humans off the doomed planet. With his own planet in turmoil over aiding so many other species, and the universe at risk from the catastrophic plague, Viper never expected to find Hope.

This would have worked out better for all involved if they hadn’t arrived after a mutated plague wiped out half the planet, turned the rest into shambling, near-unstoppable animals, and basically destroyed human civilization. You know—your standard apocalypse. The Krakau’s first impulse was to turn their ships around and go home. After all, it’s hard to establish diplomatic relations with mindless savages who eat your diplomats. Their second impulse was to try to fix us. A century later, human beings might not be what they once were, but at least they’re no longer trying to eat everyone. Mostly.Marion “Mops” Adamopoulos is surprisingly bright (for a human). As a Lieutenant on the Earth Mercenary Corps Ship Pufferfish, she’s in charge of the Shipboard Hygiene and Sanitation team. When a bioweapon attack by an alien race wipes out the Krakau command crew and reverts the rest of the humans to their feral state, only Mops and her team are left with their minds intact.Escaping the attacking aliens—not to mention her shambling crewmates—is only the beginning. Sure, Mops and her assortment of space janitors and plumbers can clean the ship, but flying the damn thing is another matter. As they struggle to keep the Pufferfish functioning and find a cure for their crew, they stumble onto a conspiracy that could threaten the entire alliance.A conspiracy born from the truth of what happened on Earth all those years ago…",2017,"{'Science Fiction': 201, 'Humor': 74, 'Fiction': 48, 'Space (Space Opera) ': 38, 'Space': 24, 'Science Fiction (Aliens) ': 22, 'Apocalyptic (Post Apocalyptic) ': 16, 'Fantasy': 13, 'Humor (Comedy) ': 13, 'Adventure': 12}",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31363503-terminal-alliance

And working at Norcoast Base, set in an ideal location just where the Tannu River sped down the west side of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast was the perfect situation for Mac.

Brymn had sought out Mac because she was a biologist -- a discipline strictly forbidden among his own people -- and he felt that through her expertise she might be able to help him discover what had created the Chasm. But Mac had little interest in alien races and in studies that ranged beyond Earth, and as politely as she was capable of, she tried to make it clear that she was unwilling to abandon her own work.However, the decision was soon taken out of her hands when a mysterious and devastating attack on the Base resulted in the abduction of Emily, and forced Mac to flee for her life with Brymn and the Earth special agents who were escorting him. Suddenly, it appeared that Earth itself might be under attack by the legendary race the Dhryn called the Ro, the beings they thought might be the destructive force behind the Chasm.

Peace isn’t popular, but the planet can’t survive without it.Forced to marry an enemy prince for the sake of peace, Senator Royce Cleghorn doesn’t like his husband, his alpha scent, or his damned pretty blue eyes. More than anything, Royce hates what Haydn makes him become: a primitive alpha cliché who’ll do anything to mark his territory, even if that territory is his alpha husband. Royce likes omegas; he isn’t into alphas, no matter how pretty their eyes are. It’s just a weird territorial instinct. It has to be.Prince Haydn has always tried to be the perfect alpha his father wants him to be. He's the heir to the throne. He's a war general. He isn't supposed to bare his throat to an enemy alpha—and it isn't supposed to feel so good. Everyone knows a marriage between two alphas is a recipe for disaster. He isn't supposed to crave his husband—their marriage is just a political arrangement, nothing more.But when disaster strikes and loyalties are tested, which bond will be the strongest: their marriage, or their allegiances?This book is set in an omegaverse world similar to contemporary Earth, and it contains explicit content, mating cycles, scenting, knotting, and two men obsessed with each other.

It's just that what he's taken now is me!
He just threw me over his lap and trotted away with me, into the jungle of this Jurassic planet...
On a freaking T. Rex!
Because those lethal alien dinosaurs I'm so afraid of? 
Yeah, he's riding one!
There's no way I'm going to be the kind of girl who falls for her kidnapper...
But he's making it hard for me to resist. Not only is he huge and super confident, he's also drop-dead gorgeous, with his stripes and his fangs and his golden hair that shines with an inner light...
I think we're going to his cave. Judging from the enticingly large tent he's pitching in his loincloth. I think he has plans for when we get there!
And I think they involve me becoming his mate...
We'll just see about that!
Because, while he does turn me into a hot mush on the inside, an alien caveman with a dark secret, and an anger problem, feels kind of dangerous to me...

Sarah Michaels is running for her life!

Abducted into a cult called The Brotherhood of Peace at age twelve, she has grown up in an abusive system. Now as an adult, she is desperate to get away before she must become a “Bride of the Prophet” and is forced to have sex with the leader, the lecherous Father Caleb. Sarah runs from the cult… and straight into the arms of a tall, dark, angry Kindred warrior...
Commander Sazar is the ultimate diplomat but not a very good boss. In fact, he’s awful because he has the habit of biting his personal assistants. As a Pitch-Blood Kindred, he needs blood on a regular basis and since his beautiful wife is dead, he is forced to take it from the female who is closest to him. Five secretaries have quit because of his blood requirements and he’s desperate to find a new one before he goes on his latest diplomatic mission to Alquon Ultrea. Desperate enough to take on a girl with very little experience and no resume to speak of, because she’s willing to let him bite her and drink her blood!
Desperation might have brought them together but Sazar and Sarah soon find they have much in common. It’s Christmas time and a deep mutual attraction draws them together. But when a misunderstanding tears them apart and Sarah is taken by the Brotherhood of Peace, can Sazar save her? And can Sarah help him by Healing the Brokenness inside?

The Warrior's Mate,"The Warrior's Mate (Iriduan Test Subjects, #4)",Susan Trombley,English,4.02,724,73,"


Five years ago, I was abducted by aliens…. 


After a harrowing escape from an alien research facility, I found myself in the care and protection of an alien species called the Akrellians, but I didn't trust my instantaneous attraction to the commander of the ship. After all, I had no idea what the evil Iriduans had done to me, so I didn't know if my feelings were even my own or something they had caused. 
He was reptilian and had deadly quills. How could a human possibly fall so fast for such an alien male? 
When I offered Prime Commander Tirel a temporary sexual liaison, hoping it would ease the need I felt for him, he rejected it and asked for something more permanent. 


I panicked!


I couldn't escape him fast enough. Not because I feared him, but because of the temptation he offered - one that would require me to sacrifice everything I've ever known to stay with him. 
Now, after years apart, the strange bond that had formed between us upon our first meeting demands I return to him, and I realize that I can't continue to live my life without him. The only problem - I'm stuck on Earth, and I don't know how to find him again. 
Until an unexpected visitor brings me the solution - and the terrifying news that I may have waited too long.

He’s stood vigil over his people for centuries, watching them fade away, one by one succumbing to the entropic energies they hold inside. With his slightest touch unwillingly bringing death to all living things, he has remained isolated in his people’s city, his heart as empty as the buildings around him…until a pale, slight female arrives and shakes the foundations of his world.  GIVER OF LIFE…  Quinn Dalton lost everything when she was convicted of murder — her sister, her niece, her budding career — but it isn’t until she’s transferred to an interstellar penitentiary that she realizes her very life is no longer her own. Her existence aboard the Concord is a nightmare, broken only when the station is torn through a wormhole and crash lands on an alien world. After waking up alone and bloodied, but somehow unharmed, she seeks shelter in an abandoned city — where she discovers an ancient, wondrous mystery.

New York Times 

bestselling author Geoff Rodkey delivers a topical, sci-fi middle-grade novel that proves friendship and laughter can transcend even a galaxy of differences.
The first time I heard about Planet Choom, we'd been on Mars for almost a year. But life on the Mars station was grim, and since Earth was no longer an option (we may have blown it up), it was time to find a new home.That's how we ended up on Choom with the Zhuri. They're very smart. They also look like giant mosquitos. But that's not why it's so hard to live here. There's a lot that the Zhuri don't like: singing (just ask my sister, Ila), comedy (one joke got me sent to the principal's office), or any kind of emotion. The biggest problem, though? The Zhuri don't like us. And if humankind is going to survive, it's up to my family to change their minds.

BloodLust,B01CPQZSPS,Auryn Hadley,English,4.29,2885,340,"It’s a treacherous road to belonging—and once you find it, you could lose everything.In an exotic world caught in the throes of a seemingly endless war, a nation of terrorists under the thumb of an evil Emperor has set out to systematically destroy every race but their own. And they’re just about to succeed. Lauded fantasy author Auryn Hadley (The Demons’ Muse romantic fantasy series) compellingly blends heart-stopping action-adventure, heart-breaking ethics, and toe-curling sensuality, all through the lens of a Daenerys Targaryen-esque lead—the likes of which the fantasy genre hasn’t yet seen. When you were once a slave, freed only to become a ruthless warrior, ""belonging"" seems a trite concept. A pipe dream, the stuff of naive fairy tales. But not for Salryc Luxx. Private Luxx—Sal for short—is iliri, a member of an untamable race surreptitiously dubbed ""their kind"" by humans and bred thousands of years ago to protect them. Humans consider them expendable, barely more than animals. Freaks. But in a karmic twist of fate, they’re also one of mankind’s most feared predators. Abused and enslaved, the only control Sal has over her life is what military unit she serves with – if she's good enough to be accepted – and the only one to consider her is the best in the land, the Black Blades. Everyone has secrets, and the Blades are no different. But acceptance into the Blades gives Sal something she never expected—the family she’s never had, and with it, the undying protection of seven of the greatest warriors the world has ever seen. It also gifts her a devoted line of potential mates. Many of her fellow warriors will submit to the bloodlust that overtakes her in the heat of battle and can only be quenched by rough, passionate lovemaking (making way for the steamiest of love scenes). Though it’s not all war and sex. Sal very gradually cultivates deeply loving, evolving relationships with each of the Black Blades, which morphs as a unit into a reverse harem as sweet as it is fierce, and as protective as it is impassioned. But belonging has its own price. Each of the Blades would die to protect Sal. And it’s only a matter of time before the enemy moves to use this against her.Author Hadley has crafted a unique epic fantasy—and an absolute roller coaster of emotions.  Her heroine, Sal, is as loving as she is ferocious, and the demons she battles—and the way she beats them—underlie a delicate exploration of the ethical and political battles we face in every war we fight. Hadley’s clever takes on racial prejudice are subtle, yet damning—and her idea of sexual politics is a rip-roaring turn-on. Every female reader will want to be Sal… and every male, like the guys in the book, will fall for her. The first book in the Rise of the Iliri series. BloodLust does not end with a cliffhanger. It does contain adult themes, thus may not be suitable for younger readers.",2016,"{'Polyamorous (Reverse Harem) ': 153, 'Fantasy': 112, 'Romance': 35, 'Fantasy (Paranormal) ': 33, 'Science Fiction': 30, 'Science Fiction (Aliens) ': 19, 'Romance (Paranormal Romance) ': 13, 'War (Military Fiction) ': 11, 'Fantasy (Magic) ': 8, 'Fantasy (High Fantasy) ': 7}",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52069768-bloodlust

Across America, a mysterious pathogen transforms ordinary people into raging killers, psychopaths driven by a terrifying, alien agenda. The human race fights back, yet after every battle the disease responds, adapts, using sophisticated strategies and brilliant ruses to fool its pursuers. The only possible explanation: the epidemic is driven not by evolution but by some malevolent intelligence.Standing against this unimaginable threat is a small group, assembled under the strictest secrecy. Their best weapon is hulking former football star Perry Dawsey, left psychologically shattered by his own struggles with this terrible enemy, who possesses an unexplainable ability to locate the disease's hosts. Violent and unpredictable, Perry is both the nation's best hope and a terrifying liability. Hardened CIA veteran Dew Phillips must somehow forge a connection with him if they're going to stand a chance against this maddeningly adaptable opponent.

To stay 'alive', a stoneshifter must make love to a female every ten years.
 When Mila discovers her sister will be the next victim on Sacrifice Day, her normal reply would be, sorry, I'm busy.   After viewing ancient data and seeing the massive size of stoneshifters, Mila decides to rescue Tiana. Her sister is blood and she'd rather not see her tied to the sacrifice table and turned into jam.  Everything goes wrong, of course.  Lord Zarblu, stoneshifter and owner of the enormous black fortress looming over the city, turns his gaze upon Mila.  Like a giant cat with a teensy mouse, Zarblu plays with Mila. Catch...release...catch. Gentle and caring are words that no stone-beast monster should claim, surely?  Desiring something that might kill you is insane yet the sacrifice table begins to look attractive. Zarblu is a big, strong, determined male who's had a thousand, thousand years to contemplate life.  What if he isn't quite the monster she thought he was... What if he wants her to be his sacrifice?

Running through the woods to escape two deputies sounds like a great plan until they catch her. Thinking it's all over, waiting to hear the snap of the handcuffs, she instead hears a roar. A huge, tall, muscular man comes to her rescue. She's being saved by Bigfoot-and he's the sexiest thing she's ever seen. The attraction between them is instant, and after spending a little time with him, Casey wants to take him home and keep him. There are a few problems with that plan.

Not until humanity got its biggest surprise ever: the arrival of intelligent life from space. The Himika may look reassuringly human, but their unexplained behavior and eerie silence have strained relations between human and alien.  When Matt is ""harvested"" -- kidnapped -- by the Himika, he's terrified. Nothing makes sense until he wakes up wrapped in Pietr's arms. Pietr may be the most annoying, smug, sarcastic humanoid Matt has ever met. He's also Matt's bonded mate. Plato was right. Everybody really does have a better half, and against everyone's better judgment, it seems Pietr belongs with Matt.  But learning how to communicate the Himiko way (preferably without killing himself or Pietr in the process) is hard, and Matt's mentor, Aki, might be even more aggravating than Pietr. It doesn't help when Matt develops powers that not even the Himika understand. Matt isn't sure he's going to make it -- or if he'll have to let Pietr go in order to keep his mate safe and sane.

Six months of investigation have brought him to Willow House, a high class brothel on Omanai Station, as beautiful on the outside as it is corrupt on the inside.

It doesn’t take long for Alex to realize that Illythe is not in his role by choice. Yet Illythe holds the holds the information Alex needs.
